Home-sewn masks using https://www.craftpassion.com/face-mask-sewing-pattern/. We ask that you use cotton such as cotton sheets- two layers of material on the mask
please. Two layers are relatively easy to breathe through and provide about 60% of the protection of a surgical mask. We also ask that you put a "pocket" on the inside of the mask so that we can insert a filter if we are able to find them. It has been suggested that we use vacuum cleaner bag filters so if you can find them as well
we would appreciate those donations.  If you have elastic and prefer to use that instead of ties that is up to you and much appreciated.
