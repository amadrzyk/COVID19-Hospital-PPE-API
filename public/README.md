# üìì Description

This repository hosts an API endpoint (and associated code) that fetches live data from hospitals that are currently in 
need of personal protective equipment (PPE) around the United States and are seeking help.


The data is sourced from https://findthemasks.com, a US-based website where hospitals can submit requests for PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their list is updated every
5 minutes, has over 3000 different hospitals requesting PPE, and is currently in use by https://resource19.org and
https://getusppe.org, two of the largest PPE matching websites (traffic-wise) created by a dedicated group of volunteers and change-makers alike.

If you'd like to help out with our efforts, please feel free to reach out! My email is on my [Github profile](https://github.com/amadrzyk).
